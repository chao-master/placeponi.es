placeponi.es
============

A random evening's coding that lets you put a pony in your placeholder. Service available online at [placeponi.es](http://placeponi.es/). Can, of course, be repurposed to create placeholder images of any sortâ€”ponies not required.

**Standard image:** `http://placeponi.es/400/300`  
**Square image:** `http://placeponi.es/300`  
**Greyscale image:** `http://placeponi.es/g/400/300`  
**Regenerate image:** `http://placeponi.es/400/300/regen` (this deletes the current image of those dimensions and generates a new one, also applies to greyscale images)

Source code is provided as-is, with no guarantees as to quality or support.
